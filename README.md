# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and also to identify the employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.
## Results 
-	Retirement Titles
    - This table shows us the titles of the employees born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. This dataset has 133,777 entries, which is too vague and big for the information we are trying to achieve 
-	Unique Titles
    -	This table shows us the current employees from the retirement titles, which is now about half of that table at 72,459. Although this dataset shows us the employees and their current roles, the table is too congested for us to be able to break it down and see each role separately
-	Retiring Titles
    -	This table now only includes the count of employees by their most recent job title and who are about to retire. With only two column titles, this table is more readable, as shown in the picture below

-	Mentorship Eligibility 
    - This table shows us the employees who are retiring and who are eligible to be a part of the mentorship program, by only giving us those employees who are born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965. This table gives the managers an idea of who will be able to mentor the new employees filling their roles

## Summary 
### How many roles will need to be filled as the “silver tsunami” begins to make an impact?

Looking at the chart above, the total roles that need to be filled is 72,458.

The breakdown for each title is:

- Senior Engineer:     25,916 
- Senior Staff:     24,926 
- Engineer:        9,285 
- Staff:       7,636 
- Technique Leader:        3,603 
- Assistant Engineer:        1,090 
- Manager:               2 

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

The breakdown taken from the mentorship eligibility excel sheet looks like:

- Senior Engineer:     169
- Senior Staff:     145 
- Engineer:        501 
- Staff:       579
- Technique Leader:        77
- Assistant Engineer:        78 
- Manager:              0 
  
When looking at the difference between the numbers in the “retiring titles” table and “mentorship eligibility” tables, we can see that there are some titles who have more people who can mentor compared to how many of them there are. For example, there are about 26,000 senior engineers but only about 170 eligible mentors, while there are about 7,600 staff and there are about 580 of them who are eligible to mentor before they retire. This shows that for titles like senior engineers and senior staff, there might be less people having to mentor a bigger group of new employees. 

Even though there are only 2 managers retiring, neither of them are eligible to be mentors, so this will make things difficult when trying to find people to mentor the new employees with that title.
